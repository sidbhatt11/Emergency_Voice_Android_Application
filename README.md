# Emergency_Voice_Android_Application
This app was made for the Android Programming subject assignment in final year BCA @ SICSR.

Your google now does nothing when you say 'help'. What would you expect it do in emergency conditions ? This app does exactly the same. Just like google now, this app always listens to your voice (even when the screen is off) and when it listens to the word 'help' (or any custom word you would set instead), it does the following :

-Calls a local emergency number (customizable)(e.g 911)
-Send SMS(content customizable) to two emergency numbers (customizable) with your current location (customizable).
-Starts recording audio

There's more ..

-When listening to word 'ring', the app plays your phone ringtone ! Its for those who keep forgetting their phones around in silent or vibrate mode ! (This is where we got the idea of the app from)
-Say 'hello' to test whether the service is working properly.
